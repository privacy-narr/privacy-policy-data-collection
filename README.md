# Privacy Policy Data Collection

This public repository contains the encoded procedures the POEM lab used to identify eligible Mastodon instances and their privacy policies for our research. _There is no data stored or distributed via this repository._ This repository contains **only** scripts that would allow other researchers to generate new samples to _replicate_ our study. If you are interested in our collected _data_, please reach out directly to `project@email.com`.
